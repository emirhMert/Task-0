## Description
This C++ program performs the following operations:
1. Reads two integer numbers from the user
2. Calculates and displays:
   - Sum of the two numbers
   - Difference (first - second)
   - Product of the two numbers
3. Finds and displays all divisors of the first integer

## Features
- Input validation for integers
- Efficient divisor calculation algorithm
- Clean, formatted output
- Handles edge cases (0, negative numbers)

## How to Compile and Run

### Using g++ (Linux/Mac/MinGW)
```bash
g++ -o program main.cpp
./program
```

### Using Visual Studio
1. Open the project in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Run the program (F5 or Ctrl+F5)

## Example Usage

### Example 1:
```
Enter the first integer: 12
Enter the second integer: 5

===== RESULTS =====
First number: 12
Second number: 5

Sum: 12 + 5 = 17
Difference: 12 - 5 = 7
Product: 12 * 5 = 60

Divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
```

### Example 2:
```
Enter the first integer: 24
Enter the second integer: 8

===== RESULTS =====
First number: 24
Second number: 8

Sum: 24 + 8 = 32
Difference: 24 - 8 = 16
Product: 24 * 8 = 192

Divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
```
